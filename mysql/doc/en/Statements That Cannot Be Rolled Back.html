<p>
      Some statements cannot be rolled back. In general, these include
      data definition language (DDL) statements, such as those that
      create or drop databases, those that create, drop, or alter tables
      or stored routines.
    </p><p>
      You should design your transactions not to include such
      statements. If you issue a statement early in a transaction that
      cannot be rolled back, and then another statement later fails, the
      full effect of the transaction cannot be rolled back in such cases
      by issuing a
      <a class="link" href="commit.html" title="13.3.1&nbsp;START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"><code class="literal">ROLLBACK</code></a>
      statement.
