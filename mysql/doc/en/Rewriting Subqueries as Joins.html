        Sometimes there are other ways to test membership in a set of
        values than by using a subquery. Also, on some occasions, it is
        not only possible to rewrite a query without a subquery, but it
        can be more efficient to make use of some of these techniques
        rather than to use subqueries. One of these is the
        <code class="literal">IN()</code> construct:
      </p><p>
        For example, this query:
      </p><pre class="programlisting copytoclipboard language-sql one-line"><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM t2);</code></pre><p>
        Can be rewritten as:
      </p><pre class="programlisting copytoclipboard language-sql one-line"><code class="language-sql">SELECT DISTINCT t1.* FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.id=t2.id;</code></pre><p>
        The queries:
      </p><pre class="programlisting copytoclipboard language-sql"><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM t2);
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM t2 WHERE t1.id=t2.id);</code></pre><p>
        Can be rewritten as:
      </p><pre class="programlisting copytoclipboard language-sql"><code class="language-sql">SELECT table1.*
  FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
  WHERE table2.id IS NULL;</code></pre><p>
        A <code class="literal">LEFT [OUTER] JOIN</code> can be faster than an
        equivalent subquery because the server might be able to optimize
        it better—a fact that is not specific to MySQL Server
        alone. Prior to SQL-92, outer joins did not exist, so subqueries
        were the only way to do certain things. Today, MySQL Server and
        many other modern database systems offer a wide range of outer
        join types.
      </p><p>
        MySQL Server supports multiple-table
        <a class="link" href="delete.html" title="13.2.2&nbsp;DELETE Statement"><code class="literal">DELETE</code></a> statements that can be
        used to efficiently delete rows based on information from one
        table or even from many tables at the same time. Multiple-table
        <a class="link" href="update.html" title="13.2.11&nbsp;UPDATE Statement"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statements are also
        supported. See <a class="xref" href="delete.html" title="13.2.2&nbsp;DELETE Statement">Section&nbsp;13.2.2, “DELETE Statement”</a>, and
        <a class="xref" href="update.html" title="13.2.11&nbsp;UPDATE Statement">Section&nbsp;13.2.11, “UPDATE Statement”</a>.
