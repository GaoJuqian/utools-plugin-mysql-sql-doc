        The binary log is a set of files that contain information about
        data modifications made by the MySQL server. The log consists of
        a set of binary log files, plus an index file (see
        <a class="xref" href="binary-log.html" title="5.4.4&nbsp;The Binary Log">Section&nbsp;5.4.4, “The Binary Log”</a>).
      </p><p>
        The <a class="link" href="purge-binary-logs.html" title="13.4.1.1&nbsp;PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement"><code class="literal">PURGE BINARY LOGS</code></a> statement
        deletes all the binary log files listed in the log index file
        prior to the specified log file name or date.
        <code class="literal">BINARY</code> and <code class="literal">MASTER</code> are
        synonyms. Deleted log files also are removed from the list
        recorded in the index file, so that the given log file becomes
        the first in the list.
      </p><p>
        <a class="link" href="purge-binary-logs.html" title="13.4.1.1&nbsp;PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement"><code class="literal">PURGE BINARY LOGS</code></a> requires the
        <a class="ulink" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_binlog-admin" target="_top"><code class="literal">BINLOG_ADMIN</code></a> privilege. This
        statement has no effect if the server was not started with the
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a> option to enable binary
        logging.
      </p><p>
        Examples:
      </p><pre class="programlisting copytoclipboard language-sql"><code class="language-sql">PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'mysql-bin.010';
PURGE BINARY LOGS BEFORE '2019-04-02 22:46:26';</code></pre><p>
        The <code class="literal">BEFORE</code> variant's
        <em class="replaceable"><code>datetime_expr</code></em> argument should
        evaluate to a <a class="link" href="datetime.html" title="11.2.2&nbsp;The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types"><code class="literal">DATETIME</code></a> value (a
        value in <code class="literal">'<em class="replaceable"><code>YYYY-MM-DD
        hh:mm:ss</code></em>'</code> format).
      </p><p>
        This statement is safe to run while replicas are replicating.
        You need not stop them. If you have an active replica that
        currently is reading one of the log files you are trying to
        delete, this statement does not delete the log file that is in
        use or any log files later than that one, but it deletes any
        earlier log files. A warning message is issued in this
        situation. However, if a replica is not connected and you happen
        to purge one of the log files it has yet to read, the replica
        cannot replicate after it reconnects.
      </p><p>
        To safely purge binary log files, follow this procedure:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            On each replica, use <a class="link" href="show-slave-status.html" title="13.7.5.34&nbsp;SHOW SLAVE STATUS Statement"><code class="literal">SHOW SLAVE
            STATUS</code></a> to check which log file it is reading.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Obtain a listing of the binary log files on the replication
            source server with <a class="link" href="show-binary-logs.html" title="13.7.5.1&nbsp;SHOW BINARY LOGS Statement"><code class="literal">SHOW BINARY
            LOGS</code></a>.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Determine the earliest log file among all the replicas. This
            is the target file. If all the replicas are up to date, this
            is the last log file on the list.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Make a backup of all the log files you are about to delete.
            (This step is optional, but always advisable.)
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Purge all log files up to but not including the target file.
</p></li></ol>
</div>
<p>
        You can also set the
        <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_expire_logs_days"><code class="literal">expire_logs_days</code></a> system
        variable to expire binary log files automatically after a given
        number of days (see <a class="xref" href="server-system-variables.html" title="5.1.7&nbsp;Server System Variables">Section&nbsp;5.1.7, “Server System Variables”</a>).
        If you are using replication, you should set the variable no
        lower than the maximum number of days your replicas might lag
        behind the source.
      </p><p>
        <code class="literal">PURGE BINARY LOGS TO</code> and <code class="literal">PURGE
        BINARY LOGS BEFORE</code> both fail with an error when binary
        log files listed in the <code class="filename">.index</code> file had
        been removed from the system by some other means (such as using
        <span class="command"><strong>rm</strong></span> on Linux). (Bug #18199, Bug #18453) To
        handle such errors, edit the <code class="filename">.index</code> file
        (which is a simple text file) manually to ensure that it lists
        only the binary log files that are actually present, then run
        again the <a class="link" href="purge-binary-logs.html" title="13.4.1.1&nbsp;PURGE BINARY LOGS Statement"><code class="literal">PURGE BINARY LOGS</code></a>
        statement that failed.
