      The <a class="link" href="prepare.html" title="13.5.1&nbsp;PREPARE Statement"><code class="literal">PREPARE</code></a> statement prepares a
      SQL statement and assigns it a name,
      <em class="replaceable"><code>stmt_name</code></em>, by which to refer to the
      statement later. The prepared statement is executed with
      <a class="link" href="execute.html" title="13.5.2&nbsp;EXECUTE Statement"><code class="literal">EXECUTE</code></a> and released with
      <a class="link" href="deallocate-prepare.html" title="13.5.3&nbsp;DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement"><code class="literal">DEALLOCATE PREPARE</code></a>. For examples,
      see <a class="xref" href="sql-prepared-statements.html" title="13.5&nbsp;Prepared Statements">Section&nbsp;13.5, “Prepared Statements”</a>.
    </p><p>
      Statement names are not case-sensitive.
      <em class="replaceable"><code>preparable_stmt</code></em> is either a string
      literal or a user variable that contains the text of the SQL
      statement. The text must represent a single statement, not
      multiple statements. Within the statement, <code class="literal">?</code>
      characters can be used as parameter markers to indicate where data
      values are to be bound to the query later when you execute it. The
      <code class="literal">?</code> characters should not be enclosed within
      quotation marks, even if you intend to bind them to string values.
      Parameter markers can be used only where data values should
      appear, not for SQL keywords, identifiers, and so forth.
    </p><p>
      If a prepared statement with the given name already exists, it is
      deallocated implicitly before the new statement is prepared. This
      means that if the new statement contains an error and cannot be
      prepared, an error is returned and no statement with the given
      name exists.
    </p><p>
      The scope of a prepared statement is the session within which it
      is created, which as several implications:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          A prepared statement created in one session is not available
          to other sessions.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          When a session ends, whether normally or abnormally, its
          prepared statements no longer exist. If auto-reconnect is
          enabled, the client is not notified that the connection was
          lost. For this reason, clients may wish to disable
          auto-reconnect. See <a class="ulink" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/5.7/en/c-api-auto-reconnect.html" target="_top">Automatic Reconnection Control</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          A prepared statement created within a stored program continues
          to exist after the program finishes executing and can be
          executed outside the program later.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          A statement prepared in stored program context cannot refer to
          stored procedure or function parameters or local variables
          because they go out of scope when the program ends and would
          be unavailable were the statement to be executed later outside
          the program. As a workaround, refer instead to user-defined
          variables, which also have session scope; see
          <a class="xref" href="user-variables.html" title="9.4&nbsp;User-Defined Variables">Section&nbsp;9.4, “User-Defined Variables”</a>.
