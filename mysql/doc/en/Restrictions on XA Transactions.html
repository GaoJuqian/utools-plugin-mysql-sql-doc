        XA transaction support is limited to the
        <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> storage engine.
      </p><p>
        For <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">external XA,</span>”</span> a MySQL server acts as a
        Resource Manager and client programs act as Transaction
        Managers. For <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Internal XA</span>”</span>, storage engines within
        a MySQL server act as RMs, and the server itself acts as a TM.
        Internal XA support is limited by the capabilities of individual
        storage engines. Internal XA is required for handling XA
        transactions that involve more than one storage engine. The
        implementation of internal XA requires that a storage engine
        support two-phase commit at the table handler level, and
        currently this is true only for <code class="literal">InnoDB</code>.
      </p><p>
        For <a class="link" href="xa-statements.html" title="13.3.7.1&nbsp;XA Transaction SQL Statements"><code class="literal">XA
        START</code></a>, the <code class="literal">JOIN</code> and
        <code class="literal">RESUME</code> clauses are recognized but have no
        effect.
      </p><p>
        For <a class="link" href="xa-statements.html" title="13.3.7.1&nbsp;XA Transaction SQL Statements"><code class="literal">XA
        END</code></a> the <code class="literal">SUSPEND [FOR MIGRATE]</code>
        clause is recognized but has no effect.
      </p><p>
        The requirement that the <em class="replaceable"><code>bqual</code></em> part
        of the <em class="replaceable"><code>xid</code></em> value be different for
        each XA transaction within a global transaction is a limitation
        of the current MySQL XA implementation. It is not part of the XA
        specification.
      </p><p>
        Prior to MySQL 5.7.7, XA transactions were not compatible with
        replication. This was because an XA transaction that was in
        <code class="literal">PREPARED</code> state would be rolled back on clean
        server shutdown or client disconnect. Similarly, an XA
        transaction that was in <code class="literal">PREPARED</code> state would
        still exist in <code class="literal">PREPARED</code> state in case the
        server was shutdown abnormally and then started again, but the
        contents of the transaction could not be written to the binary
        log. In both of these situations the XA transaction could not be
        replicated correctly.
      </p><p>
        In MySQL 5.7.7 and later, there is a change in behavior and an
        XA transaction is written to the binary log in two parts. When
        <code class="literal">XA PREPARE </code> is issued, the first part of the
        transaction up to <code class="literal">XA PREPARE</code> is written using
        an initial GTID. A <code class="literal">XA_prepare_log_event</code> is
        used to identify such transactions in the binary log. When
        <code class="literal">XA COMMIT</code> or <code class="literal">XA ROLLBACK</code>
        is issued, a second part of the transaction containing only the
        <code class="literal">XA COMMIT</code> or <code class="literal">XA ROLLBACK</code>
        statement is written using a second GTID. Note that the initial
        part of the transaction, identified by
        <code class="literal">XA_prepare_log_event</code>, is not necessarily
        followed by its <code class="literal">XA COMMIT</code> or <code class="literal">XA
        ROLLBACK</code>, which can cause interleaved binary logging
        of any two XA transactions. The two parts of the XA transaction
        can even appear in different binary log files. This means that
        an XA transaction in <code class="literal">PREPARED</code> state is now
        persistent until an explicit <code class="literal">XA COMMIT</code> or
        <code class="literal">XA ROLLBACK</code> statement is issued, ensuring
        that XA transactions are compatible with replication.
      </p><p>
        On a replica, immediately after the XA transaction is prepared,
        it is detached from the replica applier thread, and can be
        committed or rolled back by any thread on the replica. This
        means that the same XA transaction can appear in the
        <a class="link" href="performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.html" title="25.12.7.1&nbsp;The events_transactions_current Table"><code class="literal">events_transactions_current</code></a> table
        with different states on different threads. The
        <a class="link" href="performance-schema-events-transactions-current-table.html" title="25.12.7.1&nbsp;The events_transactions_current Table"><code class="literal">events_transactions_current</code></a> table
        displays the current status of the most recent monitored
        transaction event on the thread, and does not update this status
        when the thread is idle. So the XA transaction can still be
        displayed in the <code class="literal">PREPARED</code> state for the
        original applier thread, after it has been processed by another
        thread. To positively identify XA transactions that are still in
        the <code class="literal">PREPARED</code> state and need to be recovered,
        use the <a class="link" href="xa-statements.html" title="13.3.7.1&nbsp;XA Transaction SQL Statements"><code class="literal">XA
        RECOVER</code></a> statement rather than the Performance Schema
        transaction tables.
      </p><p>
        The following restrictions exist for using XA transactions in
        MySQL 5.7.7 and later:

            XA transactions are not fully resilient to an unexpected
            halt with respect to the binary log. If there is an
            unexpected halt while the server is in the middle of
            executing an <code class="literal">XA PREPARE</code>, <code class="literal">XA
            COMMIT</code>, <code class="literal">XA ROLLBACK</code>, or
            <code class="literal">XA COMMIT ... ONE PHASE</code> statement, the
            server might not be able to recover to a correct state,
            leaving the server and the binary log in an inconsistent
            state. In this situation, the binary log might either
            contain extra XA transactions that are not applied, or miss
            XA transactions that are applied. Also, if GTIDs are
            enabled, after recovery
            <code class="literal">@@GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED</code> might not
            correctly describe the transactions that have been applied.
            Note that if an unexpected halt occurs before <code class="literal">XA
            PREPARE</code>, between <code class="literal">XA PREPARE</code> and
            <code class="literal">XA COMMIT</code> (or <code class="literal">XA
            ROLLBACK</code>), or after <code class="literal">XA COMMIT</code>
            (or <code class="literal">XA ROLLBACK</code>), the server and binary
            log are correctly recovered and taken to a consistent state.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The use of replication filters or binary log filters in
            combination with XA transactions is not supported. Filtering
            of tables could cause an XA transaction to be empty on a
            replica, and empty XA transactions are not supported. Also,
            with the settings
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_master_info_repository"><code class="literal">master_info_repository=TABLE</code></a>
            and
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-replica.html#sysvar_relay_log_info_repository"><code class="literal">relay_log_info_repository=TABLE</code></a>
            on a replica, which became the defaults in MySQL 8.0, the
            internal state of the data engine transaction is changed
            following a filtered XA transaction, and can become
            inconsistent with the replication transaction context state.
          </p><p>
            The error
            <a class="ulink" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/5.7/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_xa_replication_filters" target="_top"><code class="literal">ER_XA_REPLICATION_FILTERS</code></a> is
            logged whenever an XA transaction is impacted by a
            replication filter, whether or not the transaction was empty
            as a result. If the transaction is not empty, the replica is
            able to continue running, but you should take steps to
            discontinue the use of replication filters with XA
            transactions in order to avoid potential issues. If the
            transaction is empty, the replica stops. In that event, the
            replica might be in an undetermined state in which the
            consistency of the replication process might be compromised.
            In particular, the <code class="literal">gtid_executed</code> set on a
            replica of the replica might be inconsistent with that on
            the source. To resolve this situation, isolate the source
            and stop all replication, then check GTID consistency across
            the replication topology. Undo the XA transaction that
            generated the error message, then restart replication.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Prior to MySQL 5.7.19, <a class="link" href="flush.html#flush-tables-with-read-lock"><code class="literal">FLUSH TABLES
            WITH READ LOCK</code></a> is not compatible with XA
            transactions.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            XA transactions are considered unsafe for statement-based
            replication. If two XA transactions committed in parallel on
            the source are being prepared on the replica in the inverse
            order, locking dependencies can occur that cannot be safely
            resolved, and it is possible for replication to fail with
            deadlock on the replica. This situation can occur for a
            single-threaded or multithreaded replica. When
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=STATEMENT</code></a> is
            set, a warning is issued for DML statements inside XA
            transactions. When
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=MIXED</code></a> or
            <a class="link" href="replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=ROW</code></a> is set,
            DML statements inside XA transactions are logged using
            row-based replication, and the potential issue is not
            present.
